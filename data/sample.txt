Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval with language generation. It helps large language models provide more accurate and contextual responses by grounding them in relevant documents.

Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and learn from it.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret, and manipulate human language. NLP draws from many disciplines including computer science and computational linguistics.

Vector databases are specialized databases designed to store and query high-dimensional vectors efficiently. They are commonly used in similarity search, recommendation systems, and RAG applications for semantic search.
